                    <p>The impact of staying at home affects everyone regardless of race, color, or identity. With that being said, people who are affected by the current pandemic that don’t have a home, are taking the stay at home orders the hardest. Why this is important, is because people of different ethical backgrounds are going through these disparities. We assessed the impact of social determinants of potential exposure to H1N1—which are unequally distributed by race/ethnicity in the United States (Kumar, 2012, 134-140). In the past when dealing with a pandemic we saw a great number of people who were affected, were people who were lower income. This was due to the fact that not many people had the same protections as most.</p><br>

                    <p>People who are being deprived of going outside are facing an astronomical amount of problems. This may be from certain mental illnesses of being alone to children that are going to be affected for the rest of their lives due to this outbreak. For example, in 2004 in the USA, the national school lunch program and the school breakfast program delivered daily meals to 29·0 million and 8·9 million children, respectively; half of the lunches served were free and an additional 10% were served at a reduced price. (Cauchemez, 2009, July 20). The number of children and homeless communities is struggling the hardest to overcome the stay at home order. Although the solution is small it is an attempt to ease hunger across both groups. Children who qualify for free-reduced lunch may go to the school to receive food and homeless people who need food may receive items from organizations giving out care packages.</p><br>

                    <p>The impacts that may arise for people who are battling their mental state may introduce a plethora of mental illnesses that experience heightened anxiety or find it harder to find help. As Shevlin 2020 notes, For most, it does not have to be a mental illness, but many people are finding depression to be heightened due to lack of social interaction (p14). This lack of interactions gives people who are experiencing these challenges. Are going to find even greater challenges when the quarantine ends. Although many people who are going through these challenges, small solutions can be found in zoom meetings with loved ones and other entertainment/communication platforms to stay in touch with those you love while practicing social distancing. But still, have social interaction and find sessions of therapy to help online.</p><br>
