                    <p> According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in March of 2020 increased by 0.9 percentage point to 4.4 percent. This is the highest over-the-month increase rate since January 1975. The number of unemployed people increased from 1.4 million to 7.1 million in March (bls.gov, 2020). The surge in these measures reflects the effects of COVID-19 and the efforts to contain it. Travel, leisure & hospitality, airlines, and other industries are currently experiencing layoffs and may continue to do so, according to Thomas Simons, a senior money market economist at Jefferies LLC (Buchwald, E. 2020).</p><br>

                    <p>Although tech jobs have often proven resilient in previous recessions, Burning Glass Technologies data shows that the economic shock seems to be affecting these roles as well (Burning Glass Technologies, 2020).</p><br>

                    <p>There are declines in hiring for Software Developers across every industry, suggesting companies may not be investing much in new product development (Burning Glass Technologies, 2020). Microsoft, Apple, and HP Inc., and others have all warned they will not meet expected sales due to delayed manufacturing and production needs (Linnane, C., Lee, J. 2020). While some software companies such as Zoom, DoorDash, and Instacart are surging due to social distancing, software development overall is starting to feel a negative impact (Borowski, D. 2020).</p><br>

                    <p>Blind, which conducts anonymous surveys from technologists, found that 57.1% of surveyed technologists feared layoffs due to COVID-19. The survey also shows 24.9% of surveyed technologists are in search of new ways to supplement their income (Kolakowski, N. 2020). Millions of Americans have turned to telecommuting, but firms donâ€™t seem to be staffing up on tech support jobs to handle it.</p><br>
