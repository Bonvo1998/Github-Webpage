                <h2>Benefits</h2>
                <p>Virtual reality has set the tipping scale when it comes to our social norms and the impact that it has on our daily lives and the conveniences that it brings. It’s being harnessed by many industries to achieve user engagement and is growing year after year in popularity. Yet there are pros and cons that come behind this technological advancement to our virtual world. For example the internet can provide virtual training, conferencing, and small conveniences for everyday life such as Amazon delivery, Zoom, and Uber Eats. Yet it has its downfalls to our health and wellbeing such as addiction, health effects, and loss of human connection. As time goes on, what’s brought to us through our technology is making our everyday lives more convenient.<br> Amazon has adapted to bring more convenience to our everyday lives adjusting to the current pandemic COVID-19 by increasing capacity for grocery delivery from their Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market exponentially (Staff, D.O, 2020). As the pandemic rose in numbers, Amazon was able to provide an additional 100,000 new jobs and to add 75,000 more to help meet customer demands and assist existing employees (Staff, 2020). It’s given the opportunity for the community who were impacted by this pandemic losing their previous jobs. It’s also given the community a better sense of safety to be able to stay at home and have packages delivered straight to their doorstep whether it's items or groceries and for those who are elderly that have disabilities.<br>Zoom has made a giant leap forward in progressing towards keeping people close and connected. Since the outbreak, “The company’s daily active user count was up 378% from a year earlier as of March 22, while monthly active users were up 186%, according to data from Apptopia.” (Bary, Emily, 2020). Zoom has allowed people an alternative to being able to see friends in families and to help businesses keep afloat to connect with their employees and to continue their business ventures.
